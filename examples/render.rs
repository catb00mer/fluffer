## Routes within routes
You can use the `Client::render` function to render a function route as gemtext, such that it can be embedded into another gemtext document.

In this example, the `/api` route uses the same logic as the text beneath the header below.

The usefulness of this is honestly up in the air. I just think it's really cool ðŸ’€

=> /api Api
### c.render(api).await
{}"#,
        c.render(api).await
    )
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    App::default()
        .route("/", index)
        .route("/api", api)
        .run()
        .await
        .unwrap()
}
